# Contributing to Geode

All contributions are welcome and appreciated! Whether you want to submit a bug report, give suggestions or help with development, all we ask is that you follow the guidelines below.

## Code of Conduct

You can read our Code of Conduct [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues or bugs

Found a bug? Do you have an idea that could make Geode better? You can submit an issue on our GitHub repository. Please do check if your specific problem already has an open issue. Also, **please only open issues that are related to Geode itself**, issues that are related to installed mods will have lower priority, we'll try and tell you where to contact the developer of the mod, but then we'll close the issue.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Before starting work on a Pull Request, please read our code style guidelines, which you can find [here](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/source/styling).

Make sure you have tested the feature or bugfix that you have implemented. If you need additional help testing other platforms that you cannot access, you can ask around for help on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/9e43WMKzhp).

## Submitting bindings

If you want to help reverse engineer the game and submit bindings / class members, go to our [bindings repository](https://github.com/geode-sdk/bindings).
