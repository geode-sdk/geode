# Code of Conduct

## Notes

As an open source project, our policies are based on a Code of Conduct. Please
make sure you read it before using our services. We expect everyone to follow
the guidelines presented in this document.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling (antagonistic, inflammatory, insincere behaviour), insulting or
  derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Threats of violence or violent acts towards others
* Public or private harassment
* Intentionally dead-naming or misgendering others
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Gatekeeping others' access to mental health or accessibility tools
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful. Actions may range from a warning to permanent removal from the
community.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders directly on Discord, or via a private message
to the official Geode X account ([@GeodeSDK](https://x.com/GeodeSDK)). If your report concerns a specific
community team member or group of community team members, please send your
report to a team member that is not part of the report, or a member of the
administrative board.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All
community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Changes & Feedback

Since the world is a dynamic place, this Code of Conduct may need changes. We
reserve the right to update this Code of Conduct at any time.

We welcome feedback and suggestions. Feel free to open an issue on our
