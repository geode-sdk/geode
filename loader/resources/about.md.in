# Geode SDK
 
This mod is the internal representation of **Geode SDK**. You can customize Geode's settings through this mod.

## About

**Geode** is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) mod loader and modding SDK with a modern approach towards mod development. Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let devs handle the rest, Geode aims to be a more comprehensive project, which manages loaded mods & hooks itself. Geode has been built to ensure compatibility, portability and ease of use while retaining performance. For devs, Geode means easy development and portability; for end users, Geode means an uniform and easy experience using mods.
