    /**
     * GD has a lot of hardcoded colors. In addition, mods may very well also 
     * use hardcoded colors in their UIs, for example for CCLayerColors. This 
     * makes it hard for texture packs to reliably change colors, since they'd 
     * have to manually deal with every mod.
     * 
     * To help with this, Geode provides the `ColorProvider` class, which is 
     * just an index of colors with associated IDs. Mods should use this to 
     * define their hardcoded colors for their UIs, and texture packs can then 
     * change the color dynamically.
     * 
     * Mods are not expected to handle in-game color changes, since in nearly 
     * all cases the texture pack will be applied far from the mod's UI and as 
     * such just getting the defined color on layer enter will be more than 
     * enough. However, if the mod does add some static UI that won't be 
     * naturally refreshed after a texture pack is applied, it should listen 
     * for `ColorProvidedEvent`s to react accordingly.
