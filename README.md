<p align="center"><b>Geode</b> is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/">Geometry Dash</a> <b>mod loader</b> and <b>modding SDK</b> with a modern approach towards mod development.</p>

## Why Geode?

Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let devs handle the rest, Geode aims to be a more comprehensive project that provides all the tools needed for creating mods in one package.

Geode's goal is to solve **mod incompatibility** - to ensure that mods work together without buttons getting misplaced or hooks mysteriously disappearing.

## "Hello World!" Example

Here's a **Hello World** mod in Geode:

```cpp
#include <Geode/Bindings.hpp>
#include <Geode/modify/MenuLayer.hpp>

using namespace geode::prelude;

class $modify(MenuLayer) {
	void onMoreGames(CCObject*) {
		FLAlertLayer::create(
			"Geode",
			"Hello World from my Custom Mod!",
			"OK"
		)->show();
	}
};
```

This code modifies what happens when the "More Games" button is clicked on the home scene in Geometry Dash, showing a custom popup.
