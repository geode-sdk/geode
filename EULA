    End User License Agreement for Geode    
============================================

This is the End User License Agreement for the Geode Software. By using this Software, you agree to the terms of this EULA.

============================================
1.0. Definitions
============================================

The Software is all of the source code within the Geode (geode-sdk) Organization on GitHub that when put in a funky little blender and mashed together form the compiled Geode libraries and runtime binaries along with any additional side dishes such as the documentation website.

The Geode Team is the term used to refer to the developers of this Software. However, depending on context, it may refer to either only The Core Geode Team (people who are members of the geode-sdk Github Organization), or literally anyone who has ever contributed even a morsel of code to the Software.

The End User is someone who is using Geode and Geode-based modifications. This is the only actually kind of important term to define here, alongside Modder. The End User does not refer to someone who uses Geode to create mods, it refers to someone who uses Geode to play Geometry Dash with mods.

A Modder is someone who is using Geode and its functions in order to develope their own extensions for Geometry Dash.

Geometry Dash is a game by RobTop Games. If you're using Geode, you probably know what it is. If you're an actual lawyer or something alike looking at this text document, why? How did we end up in this situation? Can you let us off the hook if we just give you some cute photos of catgirls?

============================================
1.1. Your rights as an End User
============================================

You are not allowed to not do anything you want to without your own written permission. You are required to stop before every step of using this Software and ponder to yourself: "Is a car with a trailer driving on railway tracks a train?" Failing to do this will result in absolutely no punishments whatsoever. Not because it isn't wrong, but because we simply do not care.

In all seriousness, there are a few things you are not permitted to use this Software for. These include:

 * Use mods you have not legally acquired the rights to use.
 
 * Use mods that actively harm Geometry Dash or its community.

 * Take multiple candies from a bowl that says "Take One"

 * Enhance the development of anything related to thermonuclear weapons.

There are also things you are permitted to use this Software for. These include:

 * Use mods to enhance your experience of Geometry Dash.

 * Use mods to worsen your experience of Geometry Dash. I mean, I'm not one to judge.

 * Change mod load order in-game.

 * Customize keybinds in-game.

 * Advance the development of genetically engineered domestic catgirls. However, in case you do in fact find this Software beneficial in your quest to help humanity reach its ultimate goal of cute catgirls, you are *required* to let us know and let us come pet a catgirl every alternating Tuesday (unless the current Week is also divisible by 7).

Any act you might use this Software for that isn't explicitly listed in any of the above lists you must consult at least yourself to decide if it's okay to do. Do note that the Developers of this Software, i.e. The Core Geode Team, may, at any time, publicly announce other cases that you may / may not use this Software for, or exceptions to previous cases. In the case that that happens, you are required to - wow did I just use 'that' twice in a row? That's so cool - comply with whatever The Core Geode Team says. Unless it's Pie telling you not to use any libraries. Don't listen to Pie.

============================================
1.2. Your rights as a Modder
============================================

This section mostly lists types of mods that you are allowed to and not allowed to make. Creating a mod that has features which are explicitly disallowed within this document will result in your mod being publicly shamed and humiliated. Be warned.

You are allowed to create mods that:

 * Improve the general Geometry Dash experience.

 * Extend the Geometry Dash experience.

 * Are utterly useless. Ones that do absolutely nothing. We're not stopping you.

You are not allowed to create mods that:

 * Spam the Geometry Dash servers with lots of unnecessary requests.

 * Bypass and/or exploit useful moderation and/or community features, i.e. likebots, comment ban evasion tools, unlisted level scrapers, token grabbers, etc.

 * Collect personal user data from End Users without their consent and/or knowledge.

 * Actively harm the game.

 * Go against the spirit of fun and games.

Anything not listed in the above lists may be okay to make, or it may not. Consult The Core Geode Team in case you aren't sure if a given mod is okay to make. It is also advised to communicate and discuss with other modders in the Geometry Dash modding community about any mods you are planning on creating which you are unsure about. It might be that your mod does more harm than good.

============================================
1.3 Our rights
============================================

We reserve the right to publicly shame and humiliate you for failing to understand our perfectly reasonable and unquestionable choices in the matters of design, code, public speaking, advertising, private speaking, behaviour, protected speaking, and anything else.

Our rights are your lefts. Because we are standing menacingly in front of you. Metaphorically speaking.

============================================
1.4 Software
============================================

I am tired of writing and I don't know what to write here. It's a mod loader and a modding SDK. You didn't download it not knowing what it is, did you?

============================================
1.5 Too Long; Didn't Read
============================================

 * Geode is a mod loader & modding SDK for the game Geometry Dash.

 * Don't make mods that could enable bad actors to do bad stuff.

 * I want a catgirl.
